# WordChains
The program finds the shortest chain between two valid words from the dictionary. 
The chaining is based on the last or first two letters of each word - the prefix and suffix. Each neighbouring pair in the chain is connected so that the suffix of a word is the prefix of the next or vice versa. 

TODOs:
variable prefix/suffix length;
bidirectional BFS;
multithreading;
